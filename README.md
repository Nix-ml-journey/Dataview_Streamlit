# Dataview_Streamlit

I perform data cleaning and EDA on Kaggle's "The World's Billionaires by Forbes" dataset, then train regression models to generate predictions. The results are presented in an interactive Streamlit app for intuitive analysis and visualization.

I also use Cursor to help me with coding. The project structure will evolve over time as development continues.

## Update for the things that I update. 

I have implemented CSV export functionality that allows users to download the complete Forbes billionaires dataset and model results. Users can export data from the "Data Overview" page and model performance metrics from the "Results" page for external analysis and further processing.

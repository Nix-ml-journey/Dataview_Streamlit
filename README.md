# Dataview_Streamlit

I perform data cleaning and EDA on Kaggle's "The World's Billionaires by Forbes" dataset, then train regression models to generate predictions. The results are presented in an interactive Streamlit app for intuitive analysis and visualization.

I also use Cursor to help me with coding. The project structure will evolve over time as development continues.

## Update for the things that I update. 

I have added a Project Status Dashboard that displays key metrics including dataset health, missing values count, number of models trained, and system status. This provides a quick overview of the project's current state right on the home page.
